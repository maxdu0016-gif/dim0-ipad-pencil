/**
 * Force `style.autoFit = false` on incoming custom-type nodes whose lib
 * grow-to-fit must stay off (sheet, code-sandbox, widget, mini-app,
 * folder, document — they render only a preview of `node.content`).
 *
 * Defense-in-depth mirroring the server's `note_to_wire` guard: an
 * agent-created sheet from an un-upgraded backend, or a replayed
 * catch-up batch, could arrive with `autoFit` unset (→ on in the lib),
 * and the next local content edit would then grow the node to fit the
 * whole markdown body, uncapped. The frontend converter (`note-to-node`)
 * already does this for snapshot / local-create paths; this covers the
 * remote-op path the same way `normalizeBatchColorsForLocalTheme` covers
 * colors.
 *
 * Mutates the batch in place — it is owned by the caller at this point
 * (decoded from JSON moments ago) and `attachSync` reads style after.
