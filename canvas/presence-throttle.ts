/**
 * Leading + trailing-edge throttle for outbound presence frames.
 *
 * Cursors fire on every pointermove (~60Hz); broadcasting them all-to-all
 * is N² over peer count. Throttle to ~20Hz: the first frame goes out
 * immediately (peers see the cursor pop in), subsequent frames within
 * the window are coalesced and the final one fires at the window
 * boundary (a stopping cursor still lands its final position).
 *
 * Pure timer-driven logic, no WS or canvas-harness dependencies — keeps
 * the unit test trivial with `vi.useFakeTimers`.
