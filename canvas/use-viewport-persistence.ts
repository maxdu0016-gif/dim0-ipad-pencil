 * Time to wait after the last camera change before persisting. Picks up

/**
 * Per-board camera persistence with near-zero per-frame cost.
 *
 * Strategy: subscribe to the lib's `'camera'` event and debounce-save
 * 200ms after the camera stops moving. Catches pan + zoom + any
 * programmatic `setCamera` (URL deep-link, presentation-mode exit,
 * zoom-reset button) uniformly. Replaces a prior interaction-mode
 * gating approach that missed the Windows / mouse pan path
 * (`panning → marqueeing → idle`) because the marquee gesture
 * intercepts the gesture end before idle.
 *
 * Restore: read the saved camera once after the caller signals
 * `ready` (i.e., after the scene has hydrated) and call
 * `store.setCamera` with the stored value. Skipped silently if no
 * entry exists for this scope.
 *
 * Cleanup flushes any pending save before unsubscribing — covers the
 * pan-then-navigate-fast race where the user moves to another board
 * within the debounce window.
 *
 * Pass `boardId = null` (e.g., between routes) to suspend both restore
 * and save without unmounting.
