 * tool's defaults in dark mode are already theme-adapted (display

/**
 * Rewrite pasted local `edge.add`s so they belong to the current
 * scope and paint in the current theme.
 *
 * Fresh arrow-drawn edges are stamped at creation time via
 * `arrowDefaults.{data,style}` in `harness-canvas` (canvas-harness
 * 0.1.24+), so they enter the store already initialized — the init
 * stamp doesn't need a follow-up `updateEdge` here. That removed
 * a redundant undo batch (Cmd+Z on a fresh edge used to take two
 * presses).
 *
 * Two stamps remain, both only relevant to **paste**:
 *
 *   - **rescope stamp** (scope mismatch): a pasted edge carries
 *     `version` + `_storedColors` from the source but its
 *     `data.graphUid`/`parentId` point at the source scope. Without
 *     this, a cross-board paste lands the edge with the source's
 *     `parent_id` and the REST root filter excludes it on refresh —
 *     same disappearing-on-refresh class of bug as nodes
 *     (see `use-stamp-new-nodes`).
 *
 *   - **retheme stamp** (theme stale): a pasted edge's `style.*` is
 *     baked for whatever theme was active at copy-time. If the user
 *     toggled theme between copy and paste — even in the same scope —
 *     the rendered colors would mismatch the current mode until the
 *     next theme toggle re-projects them.
 *
 * Hydrated edges arrive with `origin === "remote"` and are filtered
 * out by the batch-origin check.
 *
 * Invariant for future contributors: any new emitter of a local
 * `edge.add` must either pre-stamp scope + project style for current
 * theme (like the mindmap drain in `use-harness-apply-mindmap`, or
 * the arrow-tool factories in `harness-canvas`) or accept being
 * rewritten here (paying a second undo step).
