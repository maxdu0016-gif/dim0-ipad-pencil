/**
 * Resolve which collab client a synced board mounts: the offline-first
 * coordinator (`v2`) or the legacy `use-ws-collab` (`legacy`).
 *
 * Source of truth is the board's `BoardMeta.syncEngine` (persisted in the local
 * registry). The `dim0SyncV2` localStorage flag stays as a dev/testing override
 * that forces v2 on any board — it wins over the stored engine. A board with no
 * local meta and no override resolves to `v2` (the default as of Phase 1 of the
 * backend-agent retirement); a board can still be pinned to the legacy client
 * with an explicit `syncEngine: "legacy"` (an escape hatch during rollout).
