# Dim0 for iPad

The iPad target now hosts the complete Dim0 application in a persistent native
`WKWebView`. It is the same product as the browser and desktop clients: AI chat,
notes, files, mini-apps, local boards, synced boards, presentation mode, and all
canvas node types remain available instead of being rebuilt as a reduced native
client.

Apple Pencil input is rendered immediately by a transparent native `PKCanvasView`
over the active board. The complete `PKDrawing` stays local, is saved per board
after 550 ms of idle time, and follows the web canvas camera while the user pans
or zooms. Finishing a Pencil stroke does not sample points, serialize JSON, or
call JavaScript. The toolbar's **同步手写** action is the only path that converts
the full local drawing into formal web ink nodes; the ordinary persistence and
WebSocket v2 collaboration paths then carry that explicit snapshot. Finger
pan/zoom remains on the web canvas, and one native double-tap listener switches
between PencilKit's pen and vector eraser.

## Application URL

Release builds load the dedicated iPad frontend at
`https://dim0-ipad-pencil.pages.dev` by default. Change `Dim0AppURL` in
`ios/Info.plist` to point the shell at another hosted/self-hosted Dim0 frontend.
For an Xcode development run, the `DIM0_APP_URL` scheme environment variable
overrides the plist value, for example `http://192.168.1.20:5175`.

The shell keeps a persistent WebKit data store, so authentication, IndexedDB
local boards, preferences, and cached web assets survive app restarts. Native
file input and download/share handling keep document upload and export usable on
iPad.

## Generate and run the Xcode project

```sh
brew install xcodegen
cd ios-native
cd ios
xcodegen generate
open Dim0Native.xcodeproj
```

`ios/project.yml` is the source of truth. The generated `.xcodeproj` is ignored
and is recreated locally, by EAS, and by GitHub Actions before every build.

The bundle identifier is `com.dim0.canvas` so the existing Apple Developer
device registration and provisioning profile can be reused.
