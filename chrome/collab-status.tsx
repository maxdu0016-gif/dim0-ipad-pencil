 * Collab WS status pill. Hidden during normal operation (`idle`, `live`)
 * so it doesn't squat in the chrome; surfaces during transitions
 * (`connecting` on first open, `reconnecting` during backoff) and
 * after max-attempts (`failed`).
 *
 * Layout owned by the caller — sits next to the save-status pill in
 * `harness-canvas.tsx`.
