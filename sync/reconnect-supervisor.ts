/**
 * Reconnect supervisor for the offline-first coordinator.
 *
 * The coordinator + `ws-relay` are transport-focused; this owns the *timing*:
 * on an unexpected socket close it schedules a backoff retry (reusing the
 * legacy `computeBackoffMs`), resets on a successful welcome, gives up after
 * `maxAttempts`, and retries immediately when a backgrounded tab returns. It
 * drives the shared `CollabConnState` so the status pill works for both clients.
 *
 * Timer + state setter are injectable so the whole state machine is unit-tested
 * with fake timers, independent of any real socket.
