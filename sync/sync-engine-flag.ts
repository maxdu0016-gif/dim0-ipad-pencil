/**
 * Per-board sync-engine dev override (localStorage).
 *
 * The source of truth for a synced board's engine is now `BoardMeta.syncEngine`
 * (see `use-sync-engine`); this flag is a testing override that *forces* v2 on
 * any board without touching its metadata, so v2 can be exercised on legacy
 * backend boards that have no local meta yet.
 *
 * Toggle from the dev console: `dim0SyncV2.on("<boardId>")` then reload.
 * Deleted once v2 is the default and the legacy client is retired.
