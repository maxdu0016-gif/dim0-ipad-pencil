/**
 * Collapse repeat update ops on the same target within a single batch.
 *
 * A compound edit (a `store.batch(...)`) can emit several `node.update` /
 * `edge.update` ops for the same id; a peer only needs the final value. Keep the
 * FIRST op's `prev` (the starting point, so conflict detection has a meaningful
 * anchor) and merge later patches over it (last value wins per field). Non-update
 * ops pass through in order. Returns the same batch when nothing collapses (no
 * allocation); clones the ops it keeps so the raw oplog batch is never mutated.
 *
 * Scope: this only helps MULTI-OP batches. A drag/resize emits one op per
 * pointer-tick as SEPARATE batches — collapsing those is cross-batch coalescing,
 * which is deferred (it complicates ack/cursor + reconnect-replay dedup).
