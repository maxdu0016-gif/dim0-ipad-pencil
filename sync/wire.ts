/**
 * Sync wire protocol — the transport-agnostic contract between a client and the
 * relay. A `RelayConnection` is anything that can carry these messages: the
 * in-memory relay (tests) and the real WebSocket (E1.5) both implement it, so the
 * sync coordinator is written once and runs against either.
 *
 * A focused subset of the production protocol (enough for offline convergence);
 * snapshot-in-welcome, presence-leave and kick land with the real transport.

 * The welcome handshake. `since_seq` is sent at connect time (a query param on

 *   - `snapshot`: first connect (or a drift past the log) → full board payload
 *     to hydrate the local replica; the coordinator hands `snapshot` to its
 *     hydration hook (the shape is transport-specific, opaque here).
 *   - `catch-up`: reconnect within the log → the missed batches, each carrying
 *     its relay `seq` for serverSeq-ordered replay.
 *   - `live`: already current → no payload.
