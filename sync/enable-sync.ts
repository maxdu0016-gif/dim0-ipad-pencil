/**
 * Enable-sync orchestrator: promote a local-only board to synced (local → synced).
 *
 * The state machine, with deps injected so it unit-tests without IndexedDB or
 * the network. Order matters for both retry-safety AND the "edit during the sync
 * window" hazard:
 *   1. CAPTURE the board's content + the oplog seq it reflects (the base).
 *   2. ADOPT that base on the server (rebuilds the graph from it).
 *   3. FOLD the captured base into a local snapshot, truncating the oplog ONLY up
 *      to the captured seq. This is the crux: an edit made during steps 1–2 lands
 *      at a HIGHER seq and stays pending, so the v2 coordinator ships it to the
 *      server on connect — it is neither lost nor double-applied (the adopted
 *      base was folded away, not re-sent).
 *   4. MARK the board synced/v2 LAST, so a failure before this leaves it local and
 *      re-runnable (adopt is idempotent; a re-capture picks up any window edits).
