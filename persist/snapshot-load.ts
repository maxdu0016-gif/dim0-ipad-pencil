 *
 *   - `"replace"` (default — used by `hydrateBoardStore` on first load):
 *     nuke the store and replay the snapshot. Undo history is cleared
 *     because a fresh hydration is never undoable.
 *   - `"merge"` (used by the WS welcome handler on reconnect /
 *     authoritative sync): diff against current store state and apply
 *     minimal changes. Empty snapshots are a no-op, NOT a wipe — a
 *     server-side DB hiccup that yields `{}` won't blank the canvas.
 *     Undo history is preserved.
 *
 * Hydration is a server-truth replay, not a user edit. We ship the
 * whole thing as ONE `origin: "remote"` batch so the local-batch
 * subscribers stay quiet — most importantly `useStyleMemory` (which
 * would otherwise sponge every hydrated node's style and clobber the
 * user's sticky picks on every board nav) and `attachSync` (which
 * would otherwise re-ship the welcome merge back to the server).
 *
 * The shape conversion (`noteToNode` / `linkToEdge`) is identical in
 * both modes; only the mutation strategy against the existing store
 * differs.
