/**
 * Ask to mount `id` on this board. The scheduler grants ~one request per frame
 * (nearest viewport center first) while the camera is at rest, so a settle into a
 * region full of heavy nodes trickles in instead of freezing the main thread.
 * Returns a withdraw fn — call it when the node no longer wants to mount (camera
 * moved, node left view, or it unmounted); withdrawing drops the request from the
 * queue WITHOUT granting it, which is how "drop all waiting jobs on move" works
 * (every visible candidate withdraws when the camera moves).
