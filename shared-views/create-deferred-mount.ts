/**
 * Factory for the "defer heavy on-canvas node mounting until the pan settles"
 * behavior shared by heavy node views (mini-app iframes, sheet editors). Each
 * call creates an INDEPENDENT retention pool (per node type), scoped per board
 * (per CanvasStore) so two boards overlapping during a route transition never
 * evict each other's retained nodes. The returned hook:
 *   - a FRESH node mounts only after the camera settles, and then only when the
 *     shared per-board scheduler grants it a slot (~one per frame, nearest
 *     viewport center first) — so a settle into a region full of heavy nodes
 *     trickles in instead of freezing the main thread, and a new pan drops the
 *     un-granted requests instead of fighting them;
 *   - a RETAINED node (kept alive from a recent visit) mounts instantly, bypassing
 *     the scheduler;
 *   - a mounted node stays while it's in view OR retained, so a genuinely visible
 *     node is never torn down; it unmounts only once off-screen AND evicted;
 *   - retains the most-recently-active `cap` off-screen nodes (bounded LRU).
