/**
 * Build a canvas-harness ThemeResolver for a Dim0 theme variant.
 *
 * Resolves the five fallback tokens canvas-harness asks for —
 * `strokeColor`, `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `edge.strokeColor`,
 * `edge.label.background` — from the theme's swatch trio (bg, primary,
 * accent). Per-node `style.*` always wins; this only fills gaps for
 * nodes/edges without an explicit color set.
 *
 * Also exposes a few extra tokens (`card`, `card.border`,
 * `muted-foreground`) for custom-node canvas placeholders to read.
 * These come straight from the CSS vars so they track theme switches
 * without duplicating values here.
