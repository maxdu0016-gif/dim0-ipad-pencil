 * wrapper today — exists so the rest of the app imports from a single
 * `harness/store` entry point and so we can layer board-level
 * conventions (logging, presence wiring, etc.) without touching call
 * sites later.
 *
 * `idGenerator` overrides the lib default (`${clientId}-${counter}`) with
 * Dim0's existing UUID scheme so backend validation accepts every
 * canvas-harness-issued id (arrow tool, addImage/addSvg, copy-paste,
 * drag-to-create). Without this, the server rejected POST /links with
 * "not a valid point ID, valid values are either an unsigned integer
 * or a UUID".
