 * Folder node — nested-board entry point. Phase 4 wires double-click on
 * a folder node to router navigation; the view here only renders the
 * card. The placeholder paints at low zoom (≤ minZoomForReact).
 *
 * `view` is truthy → the renderer adds this node's id to its overlay
 * set whenever camera.z ≥ minZoomForReact and the node isn't moving.
 * The actual React mount goes through `<Canvas renderCustomNodeView>`
 * (which dispatches to VIEW_REGISTRY in render-view.tsx).
