/**
 * Node types whose deletion is DURABLE — not undoable, and confirmed first.
 *
 * These nodes own state outside the canvas store (a document's markdown +
 * chunks in `DocRepo`; a folder's whole subtree, which cascades). Undoing such
 * a delete can't losslessly restore that external state, so we take the delete
 * off the undo stack (apply it as `history` origin) and gate it behind a
 * confirm dialog instead. This map is the single source of truth for both:
 * add an entry to make a new node type durable + confirmed on delete.
